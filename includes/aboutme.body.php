    Hello, my name is Anthony Sottile.  At the time of writing this, I am
     attending the University of Michigan, studying Computer Science and
     Biochemistry.

<p>
    Some of my favorite things to do include downhill ski racing, bicycling,
     running, programming, and playing video games -- one of my favorites is
     Minecraft.
