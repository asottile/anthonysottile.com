<p>
    <a href="<?=url('android_kenken')?>">KenSquared</a> is my first Android application.
    Similar in gameplay to the popular game Sudoku, KenKen is a puzzle game that involves strategic placing
     of numbers in a square.  The unique aspect of KenKen is the constraints on placing numbers.  The game
     board is divided into regions of squares called cages.  For each cage, a number and a mathematical
     operator are shown and the numbers that you place in that square must, with the given operator, yield
     the number in the cage.  Like Sudoku, a number must appear only once in a given row or column, but can
     be present more than once inside a given cage.
