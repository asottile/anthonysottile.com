            Similar in gameplay to the popular game Sudoku, KenKen is a puzzle game that involves strategic placing
            of numbers in a square.  The unique aspect of KenKen is the constraints on placing numbers.  The game
            board is divided into regions of squares called cages.  For each cage, a number and a mathematical
            operator are shown and the numbers that you place in that square must, with the given operator, yield
            the number in the cage.  Like Sudoku, a number must appear only once in a given row or column, but can
            be present more than once inside a given cage.
